# TAGGING YOUR COMMITS

It is always a good idea to tag the commits. Try to follow the basic tags for better readability.

    [Fix]: Use this tag when you're fixing a bug or resolving an issue.
    [Feature]: Use this tag when you're introducing a new feature.
    [Refactor]: Use this tag when you're refactoring code without changing its behavior.
    [Docs]: Use this tag when you're updating documentation.
    [Test]: Use this tag when you're adding or modifying tests.
    [Style]: Use this tag when you're making stylistic changes (e.g., formatting, whitespace) without altering the code's functionality.
    [Performance]: Use this tag when you're improving the code's performance.
    [Chore]: Use this tag for general maintenance tasks, such as updating dependencies or configuration files.
    [Experimental]: Use this tag for experimental changes that aren't yet ready for production.
    [WIP]: Use this tag for work in progress commits that aren't complete yet.

For example:

    [Fix] Resolved issue with user authentication
    [Feature] Added user profile page
    [Refactor] Simplified logic for data processing
    [Docs] Updated installation instructions
    [Test] Added unit tests for user service
    [Style] Formatted code according to PEP8
    [Performance] Optimized database queries
    [Chore] Updated package dependencies
    [Experimental] Implemented new search algorithm (incomplete)
    [WIP] Work in progress: Implementing user authentication

Custom tags are okay as long as they are understandable.
